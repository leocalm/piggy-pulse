# PiggyPulse — Dashboard Final Specification

## Purpose

The Dashboard provides macro-level financial clarity. It answers:

1. Where am I in this period?
2. How stable have I been over time?
3. What is my overall financial position?
4. Where is my trajectory heading?

It is descriptive, not advisory. No coaching, no judgment.

---

## 1. Current Period Card

Displays:
- Total Budget
- Total Actual Spend
- Remaining in this period
- % Used
- Days remaining
- Projected spend at current pace

Projection is secondary text. It informs but does not dominate.

No language such as “over” or “under.” Use arithmetic values only.

---

## 2. Budget Stability (Core KPI)

Displays:
- % of periods within tolerance range
- Count (e.g., 18 of 23 periods within range)
- Recent 6-period indicator (dot or minimal visual system)

Purpose:
Surface longitudinal consistency without emotional framing.

---

## 3. Net Position

Displays:
- Total Net Position
- Change this period
- Breakdown: Liquid / Protected / Debt

No celebratory or warning styling.
Pure structural financial state.

---

## Tone & Constraints

- No red/green morality coding.
- No coaching phrases.
- Projection is contextual, not headline.
- Dashboard remains macro-oriented.
