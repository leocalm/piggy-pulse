# INTERACTION_LANGUAGE_PERIODS_EXTENSION.md

## Principles
- Neutral, descriptive language
- Explain consequences without alarm
- No moral framing (no “good/bad spending”)

## Copy Patterns

### Schedule update disclosure
Preferred:
- “Updating schedule regenerates future periods. Past and current periods are not changed.”
Avoid:
- “Warning! This will delete your periods.”

### Editing past transactions
Preferred:
- “This transaction is in a closed period. Saving updates historical totals and charts.”
Avoid:
- “You cannot edit closed periods.”
Avoid:
- “Danger: editing history.”

### Regeneration with future-dated transactions
Preferred:
- “Future periods may change. Future-dated transactions will appear in the appropriate period based on date.”

## Confirmation Tone
- Disable schedule: “Disable automatic period creation?” + concise consequence list
- Delete manual future period: only if no transactions in range OR explicitly allowed; describe impact
