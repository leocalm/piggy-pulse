## Product Adjective

Calm Reflection

PiggyPulse is a financial reflection tool, not a coaching system.

---

## Design Doctrine

### Color
- No emotional spikes.
- Overspending is shown as deviation, not alarm.
- Neutral palette dominance.

### Motion
- Subtle transitions only.
- No bounce or urgency animations.

### Language
Descriptive, not prescriptive.

Avoid:
- “Great job!”
- “You need to cut…”
- “Warning!”

Prefer:
- “Spent 62% of target.”
- “Deviation +12%.”

## Behavioral Philosophy

The product reveals behavior.
The user interprets behavior.
The system does not judge behavior.
