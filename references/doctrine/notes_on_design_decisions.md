# NOTES_ON_DESIGN_DECISIONS

## Direction Column Added
Even if UI hides it, DB stores direction for consistency.

## Transfer = Single Logical Entity
Not two mirrored rows.

## Scope as Context, Not Filter Only
Scope drives default transfer behavior.

## Neutral Tone Philosophy
No punitive UX.
Informative only.
