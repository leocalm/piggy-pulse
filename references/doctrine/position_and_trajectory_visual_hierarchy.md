# POSITION_AND_TRAJECTORY_VISUAL_HIERARCHY.md

## Core Principle

PiggyPulse prioritizes:

1. Clarity of Position (current state)
2. Deviation from target
3. Trajectory (trend & projection)
4. Historical context

Visual hierarchy must reflect this ordering across all pages.

---

## 1. Position Grammar (Primary Layer)

Position represents the current value within the current period.

### Rules

- Largest numeric element in the section.
- High contrast (text-primary).
- Always displayed before charts.
- Numeric-first formatting.

Example:

€430 / €600

Never:
- Use “Remaining” as primary number.
- Use alarm-based wording.

---

## 2. Deviation Grammar (Secondary Layer)

Deviation is contextual, not emotional.

Example:

Deviation: +€30 (+5%)

### Rules

- Neutral accent tone.
- No pure red.
- No blinking or animated emphasis.
- Always visually subordinate to position.

---

## 3. Trajectory Grammar (Tertiary Layer)

Includes trend and projection.

### Rules

- Trend line thinner than actual value line.
- Projection dashed.
- Lower opacity.
- Y-axis must not exaggerate differences.
- Projection never visually heavier than reality.

---

## 4. Period Progress

- Thin neutral progress bar.
- No warning threshold color shift.
- Contextual only.

---

## 5. Emotional Neutrality Doctrine

Avoid:
- Success/failure metaphors
- Alarm states
- Coaching verbs

Use:
- Spent
- Target
- Deviation
- Balance
- Trend
- Progress

---

## 6. Explicit Rejections

PiggyPulse rejects:

- Confetti
- Streaks
- Gamification
- “You are on track!”
- “You overspent!”
- Aggressive red states
