# PiggyPulse – Vision & Mission

## Vision

To become a reflective financial clarity platform that helps individuals and families understand
their spending patterns over time — without judgment, coercion, or artificial gamification.

PiggyPulse is built on the belief that:
- Life is unpredictable.
- Overspending is sometimes inevitable.
- Financial awareness should reduce stress, not increase it.
- Clarity leads to better long-term alignment.

The product does not coach, shame, or punish.
It describes reality clearly and lets the user decide.

## Mission

Build a security-informed, multi-surface SaaS platform that:

- Enables flexible budgeting periods (user-defined start, duration, recurring or open-ended).
- Surfaces alignment trends instead of isolated snapshots.
- Prioritizes architectural clarity and operational security.
- Treats users as rational adults capable of making their own decisions.
- Evolves intentionally through measurable product hypotheses.

## Core KPI

Alignment Consistency Over Time.

Definition:
Percentage of periods where the user stayed within (or below) their overall and category-level targets,
adjusted with a small tolerance buffer (e.g., 5%) to reflect real-life variability.

Everything on the dashboard derives from this.
