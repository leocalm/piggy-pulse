# Dashboard Strategy – Product Alignment

## Purpose of the Dashboard

The dashboard is not a reporting wall.

It is a reflective surface that answers:

- Where am I in this period?
- How am I trending?
- Am I aligned over time?

---

## Primary Cards (Core)

1. Period Status
   - Combined budget vs actual
   - Remaining days
   - Alignment status (within tolerance or outside)
   - Neutral descriptive language

2. Alignment Trend
   - Rolling multi-period view
   - Percentage of periods within target
   - No celebratory language
   - No punitive tone

3. Accounts Balance Overview
   - Snapshot of financial reality
   - Optional savings evolution (derived from savings accounts net delta)

---

## Removed / Deprioritized

- Recent transactions (belongs to transactions page)
- Top categories chart (belongs to categories page)
- Decorative metrics without behavioral relevance

---

## Tone Guidelines

- Descriptive, not advisory.
- No “You should” statements.
- No shame-based red states.
- Subtle visual cues instead of dramatic signals.
